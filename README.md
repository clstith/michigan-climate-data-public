# michigan-climate-data-public
This is the public version of a data analysis project I did on my own in Fall 2023. I cleaned it (slightly) up recently in a separate repository (this one) to display publicly. Tableau visualizations can be found on my [website](https://clstith.github.io/michigan-climate/).

Here are some details:  
* `api_info` is where you should store your NOAA api token
* `MI_info` stores a dict mapping NOAA stationids to FIPS codes
* `weather.ipynb` is my initial data mapping attempt 
* `WeatherMap_MI.ipynb` is my final (but still messy) Jupyter notebook that outputs the cleanest maps
